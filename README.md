PROJECT PROBLEM

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

 You are asked to implement a Python program which calculates the points that students obtain in a multiple choice questions test, based on data with their detailed responses, the answer key, and points associated to each question.
The user will have a choice to run the program to process all the students or only selected students, one student at a time, showing the totals for each student after processing each student.
The program not only calculates the points that each student gets, but it also provides several statistics. More details are provided below and check the sample runs.
The input to the program are text files in an explicit format as detailed below. Concrete data files to help you test your program are provided; you may create different data files to best test your program as long as you follow the prescribed formatting. The program should also produce a data file as output information, with a specific format, as described below.
