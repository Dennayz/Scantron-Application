# PROJECT PROBLEM

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

 You are asked to implement a Python program which calculates the points that students obtain in a multiple choice questions test, based on data with their detailed responses, the answer key, and points associated to each question.
The user will have a choice to run the program to process all the students or only selected students, one student at a time, showing the totals for each student after processing each student.
The program not only calculates the points that each student gets, but it also provides several statistics.
